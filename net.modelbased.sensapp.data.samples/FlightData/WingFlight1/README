This folder contains the flight data for a short 2min flight with a remote controlled flying wing.

Video for this dataset is at: http://youtu.be/oCEJIac2W6M

The sensor data contains sensor data for: 
fix, sats, latitute, longitude, sonar, alt, gps_alt, speed, CRS, roll, pitch, yaw

SENSOR		PARAMETER			UNIT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
fix	 	GPS Fix Status	 		boolean
sats	 	Number of Locked Satellites	-
latitute	GPS Latitude	 		WGS-84 String
longitude	GPS Longitude	 		WGS-84 String
sonar		Sonar Altitude			meters (not used)
alt	 	Filtered GPS and Baro Altitude  meters
gps_alt	 	GPS Altitude, WGS-84	 	meters
speed 		Ground Speed	 		m/s
CRS	 	GPS Course	 		radian
roll		IMU Roll Attiude (phi)		radian
pitch		IMU Pitch Attitude (theta)	radian
yaw		IMU Yaw Attitude (psi)		radian


The json files contains the data from each individual sensor (together with time and unit) using the SenML standard.

The "1hz" and SenML data has an update rate of 1 second (original data has a rate of 100ms).

WingFlight1.log : Raw data extracted from the APM2 board (altitute has been re-calibrated)
WingFlight1.gpx : GPX export of the data (from the APM Planner software)
WingFlight1.kmz : KMZ export of the trace of the flight (opens with Google Earth)
WingFlight1_sim.kmz : Animation of the flight (opens with Google Earth)
