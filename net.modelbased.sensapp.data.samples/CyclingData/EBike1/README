Data from a short trip on an electrical bicycle. 
Data was aquired with and APM2 and by looging the power data of the electrical bicycle

Video for this dataset is at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ML2MaSPtwY

The sensor data contains sensor data for: 
fix, sats, latitute, longitude, sonar, alt, gps_alt, speed, CRS, roll, pitch, yaw

SENSOR		PARAMETER			UNIT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
fix	 	GPS Fix Status	 		boolean
sats	 	Number of Locked Satellites	-
latitute	GPS Latitude	 		WGS-84 String
longitude	GPS Longitude	 		WGS-84 String
sonar		Sonar Altitude			meters (not used)
alt	 	Filtered GPS and Baro Altitude  meters
gps_alt	 	GPS Altitude, WGS-84	 	meters
speed 		Ground Speed	 		m/s
CRS	 	GPS Course	 		radian
roll		IMU Roll Attiude (phi)		radian
pitch		IMU Pitch Attitude (theta)	radian
yaw		IMU Yaw Attitude (psi)		radian
voltage		Battery Voltage			volts
current		Current consumed		amperes
ah		Ampere Hour			counter
wh		Watts Hour			counter
ctrl_temp	ESC temperature			deg C
air_temp	Cooling air temperature		deg C

NOTE: time for power and temperature data is not yet fully synchronized with other data.

The json files contains the data from each individual sensor (together with time and unit) using the SenML standard.

The "1hz" and SenML data has an update rate of 1 second (original data has a rate of 100ms).
